# php-oop
Creating merging and mapping objects based on json
## intention
In this `repository` php objects are processed without any` hardcoding` of the names of the json elements. The json input, currently from a file, can just as well come from an `api endpoint`. As long as the structure is maintained, the names and length of the json input can change without need for refactoring the code.
